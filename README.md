StevensStudent
==============

According to the survey of Stevens students and current resources that Stevens provide on the website, the new Android application, which called “Stevens Students”, should have the following 10 functions: News, Events, Athletics, Shuttles, Dining, Directory, Course, Emergency, Building, Links.

News and Events are presented in the web app part in order to achieve the best appearance. Athletics function already has mobile website, so we only need to give a reference link to it in our android app and web app. The other seven functions are achieved in the android part. We also build a server to fetch data from Stevens websites to obtain dining, news and events information.

The outline of our solution is:

1. Web app: News, Events, Athletics(Reference).
2. Android app: News & Events(Reference of Web App), Athletics(Reference), Shuttles, Dining, Directory, Course, Emergency, Building, Links.
3. Server: Fetch dining, news and events information from Stevens.
