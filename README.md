Smartphones have noticeably taken over in recent years with popularity rising in college campuses. They are portable, convenient and nearly as useful as a laptop. However, due to the screen size and less powerful browser of smartphones, it is difficult and troublesome for students to get access to school resources from school full website. Therefore, it is important to create mobile websites or a native app of the school for smartphones.

Stevens Institute of Technology(Stevens) has already made native apps for iOS and Android, and a mobile website for stevensducks. However, these native apps do not perform well enough. For instance, the “read more” button in the News Section is not working, and the information in the Events Section is not well formatted. What is more, the apps lack some useful functions such as shuttles and dining menus of school dining halls. With regard to mobile websites, Stevens only have one mobile website, which is not enough for students. Therefore, we decide to create another native app for mobile device and mobile websites of Stevens.
